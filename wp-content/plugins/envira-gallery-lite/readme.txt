We believe that you shouldn't have to hire a developer to create a WordPress gallery. That's why we built <a href="http://enviragallery.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend" title="Envira">Envira</a>, a drag & drop **photo gallery plugin** that's both EASY, FAST and POWERFUL.

Envira is highly optimized for web and server performance because we understand the importance of speed when it comes to SEO and conversion.

We were tired with the bloated and buggy gallery widgets. That's why we built Envira to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create in minutes. By using our easy to use <a href="http://enviragallery.com/features/drag-drop-builder/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">drag and drop builder</a>, you can upload your photos, rearrange them, and basically create an image gallery in 5 minutes or less.

You can easily customize with our built-in wordpress templates or create your own.

But we also knew that our developer friends may want to extend it further. That's why Envira comes with tons of hooks and filters (and yes it's all very-well documented).
